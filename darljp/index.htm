<p>Hell, from a strategic point of view, we should thank our lucky stars
for the fact that insane and polarizing SJWs exist and spend our time tearing into
these Radical Centrists, Skeptics, Enlightened Individualists (or whatever they like to call themselves)
instead of the people who create new Alt-Right recruits every single day.
Balkanization helps our cause and undermines the soft, squishy, “let’s all just get along” center.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I find the tale of Jordan B Peterson to be one of the most fascinating.
One group of people claims that he's a racist misogynist bigot who wants to bring us to time racial and gender inequality.
Yet another group of people claims everyhing he says is boring, obvious, generic self-evident self-help advice.</p>
<p>You can be forgiven for wondering how it's possible for a single person
to embody both the spirit of one of the greatest evil of modern times
and that things that everybody knows, so why waste your time on saying it?</p>
<p>Now, Jordan Peterson by no means a perfect individual.  No one is.  Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryvpyk35rh4" title="Kamina's Speech: Your Universe">no one three-dimensional anyways</a>.
And when people honestly engage with his thoughs and ideas there are interestnig discussions that can be had.
However, it rarely gets to that point.  For more often than not, media critiques of him instead filled with either flat-out lies or misrepresentations.
This happens with such frequency that simply pointing this out is considered a meme by Peterson's detractors.</p>
<p>Now the claim against Peterson I want to focus on today is one of the big ones.
Does The Alt Right Love Jordan Peterson?
Briefly after I define what the alt-right is, since that term is thrown around so easily nowadays.</p>
<p>The alt-right is very loosely organized group of people who have various beliefs on many issues.
However, they are unified by one things: the desire to have white ethno-state.  That's it.
So if you don't want to have a white ethno-state, you're not alt-right.  It's that simple.</p>
<p>So Now you'll notice that most publications focus on this idea that the alt-right loves Peterson, not that he <em>is</em> alt-right.
They do this because Peterson has repeated time...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] I'm not an admirer of identity politics, you know?  The radical rightists are playing identity politics just like the radical leftists.
They just say &quot;Yeah, the world <em>is</em> divided up on racial grounds, just like the radical leftists claim, and I happen to be white.  And I'm going to win this game!&quot;
And my injunction to radical right types has been: don't play the game at all!  Play the game of the individual, set your own house in order.
Don't fall prey to the racial idiocy.  We already did that in nazi Germany.  Didn't work out so nicely.  We should not do that again.
I've had thousands of letters by people who were tempted by the blandishments of radical right, who moved towards the reasonable center,
as the consequence of watching my videos and listening to what I have to say.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhm4X3a2_kg" title="Jordan Peterson on BBC 5 live">-- BBC 5 Live</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and time...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] Having the right degenerate to identity politics does not seem to be a positive solution.
So one of the things I would say is that: I understand why the identity politics that has been practiced
so assiduously and so devastatingly by the left has been co-opted by the right.  I understand that.
But then here's what I would say to the people on the right who are playing that game:
If you play the game of your enemies, and you win, you win their game.  You don't win.
That's not victory, you've just become the most successful exponent of their pathology.
So how is that a good thing?  It's a bad thing!  [...]
I don't think that the caucasians, let's say, should revert to being &quot;white&quot;.
I think that's a bad idea.  It's a dangerous idea, and it's coming fast, and I don't like to see that.
I think the whole group identity thing is seriously pathological  [...]
where we're making your group identity the most important thing about you.
I think that's reprehensible.  I think it's devastating.  I think it's genocidal in its ultimate expression.
I think it will bring down our civilization if we pursue it.

</blockquote>
<p>... and time...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] -- Well I think it's one of the primal sins of identity politics players on the left, and the right, just to be clear about that.
Personally, since this has got personal at times, I'm no fan of the identitarian right.
I think that anybody who plays a conceptual game where group identity comes first and foremost risks and exacerbation of tribalism.
It doesn't matter if it's on the left or the right.</p>
<p>[Dyson] -- Has the right gone too far?</p>
<p>-- Of course the right has gone too far!</p>
<p>-- How?</p>
<p>-- Well how about Auschwitz?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>... and time...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] We know what happens when right-wing governments adopt racial superiority doctrines.  Right?
We know what happens.  We get and extraordinarily toxic form of tribalism, and blood.
So that seems to be, like, a very bad idea.  But I don't like identity politics, I don't care who's playing.
And so the alt-right tends toward identity politics and I'm for the sovereignty of individual.
And that isn't what you're for if you're an identitarian, you're for the sovereignty of the group.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>... and time again that he does not like or support the alt-right.</p>
<p>So in order to avoid being charged with libel, they go with this logical fallacy approach of &quot;Well, if bad people like something, it must be bad!&quot;
This allows them to dishonestly tie Peterson together with the alt-right without getting sued.
But is it even actually true?  Does the alt-right <em>actually</em> like Peterson as all these outlets claim?</p>
<p>Now, this article will be broken in two parts</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first part, I'll go over the various articles and clips that make the claim the alt-right loves Peterson.
And see if they actually provide actual evidence for this claim, or if it's all based on conjecture.</li>
<li>And in the second part, we'll be going directly to alt-right sources to see what they think about Peterson in their own words.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#what-does-the-media-say-about-peterson" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="what-does-the-media-say-about-peterson"></a>What Does The Media Say About Peterson?</h2>
<p>First, let's look at this Slate article: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2018/01/why_is_monsanto_inviting_alt_right_hero_jordan_peterson_to_a_fireside_chat.html" title="Why Is Monsanto Inviting This Alt-Right Hero to a Fireside Chat on Farming?">Why Is Monsanto Inviting This Alt-Right Hero to a Fireside Chat on Farming?</a>
What evidence do they provide to their &quot;alt-right hero&quot; claim?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But he is best known for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos" title="Jordan Peterson Videos on YouTube">YouTube channel</a> that has made him a “belle of the alt-right,”
<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/is-jordan-peterson-the-stupid-mans-smart-person/" title="Is Jordan Peterson the stupid man’s smart person?">as described in a November 2017 profile</a> in Canada’s Maclean’s magazine.

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, perhaps Maclean has the answers we seek in the article titled <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/is-jordan-peterson-the-stupid-mans-smart-person/" title="Is Jordan Peterson the stupid man’s smart person?">Is Jordan Peterson the stupid man’s smart person?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson was in the news this week—and one imagines this makes the university sad.
Peterson first made the news and became a belle of the alt-right when, in September 2016,
he announced that he would not use a student’s preferred pronoun if he were asked to,
except that he might if he felt the request was “genuine,” and no one had asked him that anyway.
<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/is-jordan-peterson-the-stupid-mans-smart-person/" title="Is Jordan Peterson the stupid man’s smart person?">-- Maclean's</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Peterson became the &quot;belle of the alt-right&quot; because he didn't want his government to make compelled speech laws about gender pronouns.
Something that has no direct relationship to the establishment of white ethno-state.  Ooooo-kay?</p>
<p>Now some of you might be saying:</p>
<p>-- <em>Yeah, but Sitch, you're defining alt-right too narrowly. Typically, the alt-right has also very tradcon socially and against trans people.
Maybe that's why they like Peterson in this instance.</em></p>
<p>Well, I'm defnining the alt-right by the thing that makes them unique and note-worthy.
There are many groups of people that don't like trans folk.  Lots of very religious Christians don't like trans people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply stated, there is no such thing as transgender.  You're either XX or XY.  That's it.  God made man (male) and female.
That is determined genetically.  That is physiology.  That is science.  That is reality.
[source?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not mention them?  What about Hassidic Jews?  The ultra-orthodox ain't exactly down with the LGBT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Abby Stein and I identify as a woman of trans experience.  Until I was 20, I never ever mentioned it to anyone.
Because I lived in a community that is literally the most gender-segregated society in the United States.
I came out to my parents on November 10th of 2015, but I only got to speak to my father.
In my community, it's always the father and the husband who controls the family.
It didn't go well. and his final reaction was &quot;I'm not going to be able to talk to you&quot;
And I never really got to talk to my mom.  So, yeah.
[source?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Peterson the belle of the ultra-orthodox?  What about Louis Farrakhan?  He hates jews <strong>and</strong> trans folk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out, turning men into women and women into men…</p>
<p>-- Louis Farrakhan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he's not a white nationalist.  No, silly, he's a black nationalist.</p>
<!-- youtube police interjection -->
<p>And Peterson is far more tame than any of these people.  His concern was with the government legsislating required speech for gender non-binary pronouns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Host] -- You don't think that a trans woman is a woman.
Do you thing that is what is behind or explains your opposition to this idea of the law mandating you to use a preferred pronoun?</p>
<p>[JBP] -- No.</p>
<p>-- Is because you don't actually believe that that's the truth that a trans woman is a woman and therefore you can't use that pronoun?</p>
<p>-- No, that's not my argument at all.</p>
<p>-- Really?</p>
<p>-- Yeah, really.  My argument is that the government shouldn't compel involunatry speech.</p>
<p>-- I know what your argument is.  But <em>behind</em> it, the motivation.</p>
<p>-- No, that's it.  There's no &quot;behind it&quot;, there's no motivation behind it.</p>
<p>-- But you don't believe that a trans woman is a woman?</p>
<p>-- I wouldn't put everything on line in my life to take the stance that I did unless I had thought that through very deeply.
And I thought about it very deeply.  There aren't hidden motivations that have to do with some arbitrary prejudice against trans people.
It's purely and simple this: there's never been a time in English common law history where the governement compelled speech.
And the Canadian government dared to do that.  And that was unacceptable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiE7INCUFPM" title="DAILY POLITICS 2018 (May 22, 2018) - JORDAN PETERSON on the BBC">-- Daily Politics BBC</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, if the media is going to single out the alt-right versus any other group then it's only fair that it relates to the very thing that makes them alt-right.</p>
<p>The article continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, Jordan Peterson is not a neo-Nazi, but there’s a reason he’s as popular as he is on the alt-right.
You’ll never hear him use the phrase “We must secure a future for our white children”; what you will hear him say is that,
while there does appear to be a causal relationship between empowering women and economic growth,
we have to consider whether this is good for society, “‘’cause the birth rate is plummeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the lack of quotes here.  And the lack of having to do with the ethno-state.
Unless, perhaps, you may think that the birth rates comment is a dog whistle for the fear of being replaced by the non-white immigrants.
Even though Peterson is in favor of immigration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] Now, you want immigrants to come. Especially if they're the sorts of immigrants that who are likely to contribute properly to the success of you polity and lots immigrants do that.
I think that the vast majority, for example, of enterpreneurs in the United States come from the Indian subcontinent.
So, great, you know!  Bring them over, they're highly educated, they're extraordinarily productive, they make lots of new businesses.
And they they pump money back in India.  Good deal!
[source?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See?  Oh wait a minute...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] But that doesn't mean that we have to have &quot;open to everyone&quot; immigration policy because it's complete rubbish.
[source?]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He doesn’t call for a “white ethnostate,” but he does retweet Daily Caller articles with opening lines like:
“Yet again an American city is being torn apart by black rioters.”
He has dedicated two-and-a-half-hour-long YouTube videos to “identity politics and the Marxist lie of white privilege.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/29/cultural-marxism-is-destroying-america/" title="Cultural Marxism Is Destroying America">Daily Caller article</a> which does have a pretty stupid opening line, but is actually about the dangers of marxism, not race.</p>
<p>Which a lot of people talk about that alt-right don't like, but of course no evidence is provided on how the alt-right feels like about Peterson.</p>
<p>This is all conjecture based on the author's uncharitable perception of Peterson.
Instad we see the truth about what the author means when they say &quot;belle of the alt-right&quot;.
What they actually mean is clearly stated in this Vox article: <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life" title="Jordan Peterson, the obscure Canadian psychologist turned right-wing celebrity, explained">Jordan Peterson, the obscure Canadian psychologist turned right-wing celebrity, explained</a>.</p>
<p>The article goes on to talk about Peterson's distain for marxism before landing on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Peterson’s grand theory is brilliant as a political stance
— one designed to weaponize the grievances of the kind of young men attracted to the alt-right.</p>
<p>Peterson’s framework serves as a justification for dismissing the idea of any kind of privilege
— white, male, or otherwise — as a tool used by closet Marxists to manipulate you.
He states this explicitly, calling it a “Marxist lie” designed to enable
the Marxist-postmodernist effort to seize control of the state.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Peterson’s position helps claim the mantle of “facts” and “reason” for the anti-PC right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So &quot;belle of the alt-right&quot; actually means &quot;Peterson is effective at dismantling the radical left illiberal positions.&quot;
Thus everyone that doesn't like the radical left likes Peterson's dismantling process.
And heeey!  Look at who's part of the &quot;doesn't like the radical left crowd&quot; -- the alt-right!
I guess the title &quot;Jordan Peterson: Belle of everyone who's not an SJW, (which technically includes the Alt Right as a tiny minority)&quot;
just doens't have the greatest ring to it.</p>
<p>But perhaps some other articles can shed light on this &quot;alt-right liking Peterson&quot; claim?</p>
<p>Next we have the article titled <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/10/17338290/intellectual-dark-web-rogan-peterson-harris-times-weiss" title="The “Intellectual Dark Web,” explained: what Jordan Peterson has in common with the alt-right">The “Intellectual Dark Web,” explained: what Jordan Peterson has in common with the alt-right</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A controversial New York Times article describes several popular white intellectuals as marginalized “renegades.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the Times article never uses the term &quot;marginalized&quot; even once.
No, this language is specifically coded to conjure up the image of old racist white man,
claiming they're the victim because all the uppity non-white races are suddently demanding equality.</p>
<!-- But you're a mean mad white man!  And you're gonna get us right! -->
<p>But don't take my word for it -- the article says as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is rather that dark web intellectuals, like Donald Trump supporters and the online alt-right,
have experienced a sharp decline in their relative status over time.  This is leading them to frustration and resentment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This status threat is the author's main justification for comparing Peterson to the alt-right.
Of course, no evidence is provided to show that Peterson or his fans fear some sort of status threat based on race.</p>
<!-- Great, you know!  Bring them over! -->
<p>The Guardian titled: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest" title="How dangerous is Jordan B Peterson, the rightwing professor who 'hit a hornets' nest'?">How dangerous is Jordan B Peterson, the rightwing professor who 'hit a hornets' nest'?</a> goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is also adored by figures on the so-called alt-light (basically the “alt-right” without the sieg heils and the white ethnostate),
including Mike Cernovich, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/17/charlottesville-alt-right-neo-nazis-white-nationalists">Gavin McInnes</a>
and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/dec/14/spare-thought-christmas-unholy-trinity-nigel-farage-milo-yannopoulos-katie-hopkins">Paul Joseph Watson</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, so it's like tha alt-right, if you remove the defining factor that makes someone alt-right.
But again, no evidence is provided that alt-right actually likes Peterson.
They simply repeat the &quot;Peterson gives them ammunition against SJWs&quot; argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s true that he’s not a white nationalist,” says David Neiwert, the Pacific Northwest correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center
and the author of Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump.
“But he’s buttressing his narrative with pseudo-facts, many of them created for the explicit purpose of promoting white nationalism, <em>[AN: no source or citation given]</em>
especially the whole notion of ‘cultural Marxism’.  The arc of radicalisation often passes through these more ‘moderate’ ideologues.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it: anyone who doesn't agree with the far left illiberal and is moderad is simply a gateway to the alt-right.
And we have even more Guardian articles that make the alt-right claim with no evidence.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/14/patreon-rise-jordan-peterson-online-membership" title="The rise of Patreon – the website that makes Jordan Peterson $80k a month">this Guardian article</a> calls Peterson &quot;the alt-right's favorite psychologist&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of which goes some way to explaining the surprise (and jealousy?) that accompanied the news that Jordan B Peterson,

to label him wrongly as sympathetic to its views.</p>

<p>Again, providing absolutely no evidence.</p>
<p>The Independent also has muliple articles, again, making the claim that the alt-rigt likes Peterson, but again, with no evidence.</p>

<p>The wide popularity of Jordan Peterson, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/cathy-newman-abuse-channel-4-jordan-peterson-metoo-backlash-latest-a8170031.html">once-obscure Canadian clinical psychologist and university professor</a>
who has become beloved of the alt-right, is a proof that the liberal-conservative “silent majority” finally found its voice.
Peterson, who has said that the idea of white privilege is a &quot;Marxist lie&quot; and theorised that &quot;radical feminists&quot;
don't speak out about human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia because of &quot;their unconscious wish for brutal male domination&quot;,
is fast becoming a mainstream commentator.</p>

<p>Popular alt-right provocateurs can pull in hefty figures via Patreon, over $8,000 a month for some leading YouTubers.
These figures style themselves as leaders of a new political movement, defending the world against the &quot;menace&quot; of Social Justice Warriors.
But the real alt-right business model is much simpler than that.</p>
<p>Making a buck from the alt-right is quite simple. Get a blog or a YouTube channel.
Then under the guise of political dialogue or pseudo-science, start spouting hate speech.
You'll soon find followers flocking to your banner.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Jordan B Peterson, currently raking in $80,000 per month on Patreon, and with a global bestseller to boot,
is someone who believes in white male victimhood above all else.
Peterson will literally weep, actual flowing salty tears, in front of a video camera, over the fate of the young white male.
And then he will upload the result to his YouTube channel, where a small army of devoted followers eagerly lap it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is he so controversial?</strong></p>
<p>Critics have accused Peterson of being a ”provocateur”, a member of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alt-right">alt-right</a>” and a transphobe,
labels he has shunned on multiple occasions.  He has also been called the “stupid man’s smart person”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/jordan-peterson-seems-like-a-terrible-therapist.html" title="Jordan Peterson Seems Like a Terrible Therapist">the Slate article</a> that doesn't compare Peterson to the alt-right still puts &quot;alt-right&quot; in the tags.</p>
<p>The Daily Dot is the most egregious examples.  They give no evidence for anything, of course.
But claim they have mind-reading dog-whistling powers, and they can see the true purpose of Peterson's words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peterson is careful not to explicitly align himself with fascists.
But it isn’t a giant intellectual leap from Peterson’s words to the actions in Charlottesville.
<strong>How does one toughen up if not through violence?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- What the fuck are you talking about, man? -->
<p>I think this is one of those situations that reveal more about the person writing criticism than the intended subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He says he is not of the alt-right, but he has said, “If men are pushed too hard to feminize,
they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Jordan Peterson warning you not to do the thing that will create more fascist is <em>somehow</em> him dog-whistling in favor of fascist.
Yet for all these works of &quot;journalism&quot; very few even attempt to provide any evidence for this claim that the alt-right loves Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>I found only two pieces of evidence pointed to in the media. The first is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Wendy] -- Cause I also found <a href="peterson-pepe-flag.jpg">this picture</a> of you behind the Pepe flag.  Is that you?</p>
<p>[JBP] -- LOL</p>
<p>-- That's an actual photo of you, you did that?  So this is the Pepe flag, which I'm sure you know is seen by the left as a hate symbol.</p>
<p>-- Well, you see, the left sees all sorts of things as hate symbols.</p>
<p>-- But it's used as extreme right as a way of spreading messages.  It's seen as an alt-right symbol.
This is an alt-right hand symbol.  And here you are.</p>
<p>-- It's mostly used by young men who are poking and causing trouble on social media, that's what it's mostly used for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BoOdMx_zDU" title="Jordan Peterson on political polarization &amp; Pepe the Frog">-- The Weekly with Wendy Mesley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Peterson tries to explain that Pepe is (or was) more of a troll symbol above anything else.
I say &quot;was&quot; because Pepe is a dead meme now.</p>
<!-- I did an oopsie - Pewdiepie -->
<p>But the reporter is having none of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] -- I did a video online called &quot;The Metaphysics of Pepe&quot; with Jonathan Pageau, who is an orthodox carver of icons.
If people are interested in my views on what's happening with this particular symbol and why it's occuring, there's a two hour discussion about that.</p>
<p>[Wendy] -- But Richard Spencer wears Pepe, and he's a white supremacist, he wears the Pepe symbol.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BoOdMx_zDU" title="Jordan Peterson on political polarization &amp; Pepe the Frog">-- The Weekly with Wendy Mesley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even bringing up the OK-hand sign as an alt-right hand symbol.
I guess she's oblivious to the fact that 4chan created a fake association between the OK-hand symbol and the alt-right
in order to see if the media would fall for it.  Which, of course, they did.</p>
<p>Oh come on, the Independent and ADL were able to sniff that one out.
I mean, it guess it doesn't matter that in the very picture there's a jewish guy wearing a yamaka right there.
<em>Hey, buddy, you better watch out, there's some nazi shenanigans going on behind you.  Get out of there!</em></p>
<p>I don't know, maybe he's not jewish.  Maybe he's a catholic priest.  And maybe the alt-right people in this picture didn't care
that the event they were attending featured a jew and a not-white person as speakers.
Let's just put that aside.  They're probably alt-right based on the picture of this meme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello professor Peterson. My name is Alex Van Hamme and I'm the journalist that published the photo of you, myself and another person holding a Pepe flag.
Because you were question about it on CBC yesterday, I would like to send you this personal message so that you can understand the context of the picture,
and who I am, in case you are questioned about it in the future.  I don't know if you remember, but I took that photo last June after being a guest speaker
at the Canadian Freedom Summit, which you headlined.  That night I spoke of being an individualist and rejected identity politics.
Afterwards in the VIP area for the event, a colleague of mine presented a Pepe flag, and he and I asked you for a picture with it.
I had heard you speak of Pepe on the Joe Rogan podcast as well as your conversation with Jonathan Pageau, so I knew you understood that it's not a hate symbol.
That night I was very excited to meet you, and having just spoken to a large audience about my rejection of identity politics I thought it would be allright to take that picture.
I want you to know that I'm not a white supremacist, a white nationalist, a racist or reprehensible person.
I would add that I am a grandson of a still-living World War 2 American combat veteran and my significant other is not a white person.
It's absolutely absurd to imply that I'm a nazi because I certainly am not.
The left understand that language is a powerful tool, essential for power games and I refuse to give them the power to control symbols like Pepe,
or libel people such as myself a nazi for simply disagreeing with them.  That why I posted that photo.
I suppose that was an act of rebellion against the radical left.

</blockquote>
<p>Well, I gues that piece of &quot;evidence&quot; has been refuted.
The only other piece of evidence I found for the claim that the alt-right <em>loves</em> Peterson that the media has produced is here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-- Why do you think it is that so much of what you say is so very popular with the alt-right?</p>
<p>-- It isn't.  And you don't have any evidence for that at all.  Any more than the evidence that alt-right people watch [inaudible]</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpBolQcQ8iU" title="Jordan Peterson The Wright Stuff">-- The Wright Stuff</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what's he talking about?  He's referencing this article The Forward: <a href="https://forward.com/news/national/400597/is-jordan-peterson-enabling-jew-hatred/" title="Is Jordan Peterson Enabling Jew Hatred?">Is Jordan Peterson Enabling Jew Hatred?</a>.
An article that received so much pushback that not only did they have to change the cover image, comparing Peterson to Hitler.
But two days later, Forward released <a href="https://forward.com/opinion/401008/no-jordan-peterson-is-not-an-anti-semite/" title="No, Jordan Peterson Is Not An Anti-Semite">a counter-article</a> that refuted the original article.
So what did this hit-piece on Peterson say with regard to our question?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jordan Peterson is a public intellectual adored by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and conspiracy theorists.
The neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer called Peterson, a Canadian psychology professor-turned-self-help-guru,
“The Savior of Western Civilization.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it -- the Daily Stormer called Peterson &quot;The Savior of Western Civilization&quot;.
Proof, right?  Weeeell...  Peterson said in response to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-- Oh there was all taken apart today by a number of <em>jewish</em> publications, by the way.
Showing that first of all, that was all satirical commentary on the part of alt-right, directed at taking me down, for example.
And there's an alt-right article yesterday published saying that I was a &quot;Jewish sturgeon shill&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, he was referring to this Weekly Standard article that said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wondering the actual extent of Peterson’s support at the Daily Stormer, I looked up the “Savior” reference
and discovered it’s in a vague three-sentence blog post written by a guy calling himself Joe Jones.
It turns out he was likely being ironic about praising Peterson as the messiah.
Because, just a month before his ambiguous “Savior” comment, he wrote:
“Jordan Peterson is a faggot and his fans are also faggots.”
One of his other posts is titled: “Jordan Peterson’s Fans are Massive Faggots with Daddy Issues.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that doesn't exactly sound like a ringing endorsment for the &quot;Messiah of Western Civilization&quot;,
but how do we know that Mr. Kohen interpretation is correct?  Perhaps, we have to look ourselves.</p>

<p>So how is anyone supposed to know that this troll site is not being serious?  Well..</p>
<p>The group Camera the committee for accuracy in Middle East reporting in America had this to say:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.algemeiner.com/2018/05/24/forward-forced-to-backtrack-on-professor-jordan-peterson-story/" title="‘Forward’ Forced to Backtrack on Professor Jordan Peterson Story">‘Forward’ Forced to Backtrack on Professor Jordan Peterson Story</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor white supremacist media,” said CAMERA analyst Dexter Van Zile,
who himself has been the target of white nationalist attacks.
“My colleague Jonah Cohen quickly proved that <em>Forward</em> journalist Ari Feldman
misled readers that Peterson has support among far-right racist communities.”</p>
<p>“The exact opposite is the case,” said Van Zile.
“Neo-Nazis and white nationalists vehemently hate Jordan Peterson.
It’s a demonstrable fact.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>On behalf of CAMERA, Van Zile has sent two formal letters to <em>Forward</em> editor Jane Eisner asking that the magazine
“acknowledge that Peterson is loathed by Jew-haters, neo-Nazis and white nationalists.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I guess the Forward found this information compelling enough that they actually removed the Daily Stormer line from the article.</p>
<p>Now if you look at <a href="https://forward.com/news/national/400597/is-jordan-peterson-enabling-jew-hatred/" title="Is Jordan Peterson Enabling Jew Hatred?">the article</a>, that line has been replaced with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jordan Peterson is a public intellectual adored by white supremacists and conspiracy theorists.
The white nationalist sympathizer known as Sargon of Akkad has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F17WRYklkTw">expressed his love of Peterson’s work</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oooh, I see what happens when someone proves you wrong.
You don't remove the claim, you just remove the wrong evidence of the claim,
and provide either no evidence or just make something up.
Because yes, Sargon, the guy who has debated against the alt-right several times,
and has publically stated time and time again that he doesn't suppor them.</p>
<!-- TODO: insert debate? -->
<p>And the alt-right has made it pretty clear that they don't support him...</p>
<!-- Yes, he's totally a white nationallist sympathiser. -->
<p>In fact, Sargon even debated Andrew Aglin, the founder of the aforementioned Daily Stormer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aglin] -- I don't want to take anybody's rights away</p>
<p>[Sargon] -- Of course you do.  Okay Andrew, now I think you're not being honest.
On your website you have &quot;race war&quot; and &quot;the jewish problem&quot;. Come on, don't lie to me, don't pretend that you [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Aglin] -- So, your morality is a form of justification of muslim rape gangs.</p>
<p><em>Sargon rofls</em> -- That's a good hot take.</p>
<p>-- I mean, that's what it is, man.  You can't really... you can laugh, but what you're saying is [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the Daily Stormer supporting Peterson meme has been thoroughly debunked.
Which means that the media has provided <strong>no</strong> evidence that the alt-right <em>loves</em> Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>But perhaps there are other alt-right sources we can investigate for ourselves.
Why not start with Richard Spencer, the supposed creator of the alt-right, and his official web-site.
So does he and his cohord like Peterson?  Haha, no.
In fact, the alt-right web-site says the exact opposite of the standard SJW line about Peterson and the alt-right.</p>

great individualist thinkers of our time Paul Joseph Watson, Sargon of Mossad or say, Ben Shapiro.</p>

<p>What else is there to say about these people except that they’re dangerous to say the least, and not as much of a gateway to us as some Alt-Righters like to think.
If anything, they are gate-keepers and speed bumps that allow people to take the easy way out of confronting the social malaise of our times.
They’re halfway rest-stops that allow people turned off by the rabid SJW left to counter-signal their opposition
in a comfortable way and without embracing White Identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, so Spencer's own web-site is literally complaining about that Peterson is correct when he says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] Many people write me from the right, or from the fringes of the radical right, saying precisely that listening to my lectures stopped them from going all the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, from a strategic point of view, we should thank our lucky stars for the fact that insane and polarizing
SJWs exist and spend our time tearing into these Radical Centrists, Skeptics, Enlightened Individualists
(or whatever they like to call themselves) instead of the people who create new Alt-Right recruits every single day.
Balkanization helps our cause and undermines the soft, squishy, “let’s all just get along” center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey!  Look at that, mainstream media and radical left-wing illiberals.  The alt-right is actually thrilled that you're wasting your time going after peolpe like Peterson and Sargon.
So I guess using your own your earlier logic, that would make you &quot;the belle of the alt-right&quot;.
But it doesn't end there.  They have lots more hate on for Jordon Peterson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, he makes me cringe.</p>

<p>This notion is not, of course, limited to Peterson. It runs through a certain strain of libertarianism today,

<p>Our good friend Jordan Peterson, also known as Hermit the Frog, has come under increasing scrutiny from the alt-right for <a href="https://jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/">his maniacal cucking on the Jewish question</a>.
Peterson has numerously defended Jewish overrepresentation in power, hypothesizing that the phenomenon comes down to their higher average IQs as opposed to insider nepotism which carries more weight in the alt-right intellectual sphere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8irejl/is_jordan_peterson_controlled_opposition/">A Reddit user</a> has dug up an excerpt from the foreword of Peterson’s book <em>12 Rules for Life</em> which relates how a Canadian-Jewish TV producer named Wodek Szemberg hand-selected Peterson to be a “public intellectual.” Wodek, a producer for the popular Canadian public affairs show The Agenda, is said to be “the first to put Peterson in front of a camera” after recognizing his gift of the gab.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>While this is not rock-solid proof of an organized Jewish conspiracy to elevate Peterson into his current guru role,
it shows that Peterson was groomed by a Jewish television producer to lead public dissent against
the radical left… lead it astray into the Jew-friendly dead end of classical liberalism.</p>

<p>So there you have it, <em>proof</em> that the alt-right doesn't love Jordan Peterson.</p>

<p>Alt-light gatekeeper Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>He’s raking in the Patreon beta bucks by telling people that free speech is good and that SJWs are insane – things any rational person can observe for themselves.
These classical liberal cucks have found a niche market in feigning mild opposition to out-of-control social justice warriors,
milking impressionable young men for pointing out the obvious absurdity of the radical left.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Peterson is a cowardly disgrace.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>By siphoning off potential support for the alt-right and redirecting it into Jew-friendly individualist ideology, this classical liberal clique does Jewry’s work to defang the right-wing backlash to globalism, leftism and the multicultural experiment.</p>

<p>[...] we’re very likely dealing even with a Jew in disguise and no ways in HELL is this guy anywhere near our values</p>
<p>I will discuss Peterson later. But my view is firm, this is a piece of shit, and very possibly a Jew in disguise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peterson bows down to the powers that be and has grown wealthy in the process.
He is the sort of “rebel” the multicultural elites like, one who participates in their censorship of those who would reveal the power of these elites and their hostility to Western peoples and cultures.</p>

<p>And what about Alternative Hypothesis?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[AH] -- And you coming in here and saying &quot;Oh, that's just you playing their game&quot;.
Listen, asshole, it's called existence and survival.  And the only one playing games here is <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>[JBP] -- And I always decided against it because it seems to me that the proper level of analysis [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what about Vox Day, how does <em>he</em> feel about Jordan Peterson?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Vox Day] -- Peterson's philosophy, which I call Jordenetics is ultimately anti-christian, it's poisonus, and it's riddled from start to finish with mental illness.
He is what happens when you cross Bill Crystal with Elron Hobbert and give it a Ph.D.</p>
<p>[Alex Jones] -- Absolutely, please keep breaking it down.  Because, I tried to look at video of him, closed soul in his eyes, and you can't fake that.
He looks like he is wound up.</p>
<p>-- Well, Jordenetics was created to replace the failure of the New Atheism and the neo-liberal world order, but the reality is,
is that he is <strong>actively attempting to try to keep the right from moving too far right</strong>. What he is attempting to do, is that he's attempting to provide an alternative
to the growing number of people who want a return to the values of 1950's America, who want to return to the values of white Christian America.</p>
<p>-- And they know that wave is unstoppable so they're gonna highjack it with a new, watered-down, controlled opposition to grab all of that momentum in a judo move.
and steal it, and once they've got control, use that wave to crush the real movement.</p>
<p>-- Well, I think that's the plan.</p>

<h3><a href="#wait" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="wait"></a>Wait!</h3>
<p>I finally found an alt-right blogger who likes Jordan Peterson, <a href="alt-right/an-altright-case-for-jordan-peterson.htm" title="An alt-right case for Jordan Peterson">An alt-right case for Jordan Peterson</a>.
He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the alt-right has a big problem with Peterson. These guys are like two steps above soyboys. They’re just dudes.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>SJWs are right to oppose Peterson because they see their death in his position. But they haven’t been able to dismiss and destroy him. His innocuousness makes them look worse for trying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even he has written the opposite: <a href="alt-right/an-alt-right-case-against-jordan-peterson.htm" title="An alt-right case against Jordan Peterson">An alt-right case against Jordan Peterson</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He recently wrote a post “<a href="http://jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/">addressing the so-called Jewish Question</a>.” I wrote a <a href="#https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2017/12/15/why-are-so-many-of-the-accused-jewish/">fairly cucky</a> post on the JQ, but not as cucky as him.
The unfortunate part about his philosophy appears that he actually believes it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>He will tell whites not to act as a collective as the rest of the world acts cohesively on identity.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Peterson has no interest in the alt right or its more controversial truths.  He has an interest in stopping identity politics and fringe leftism.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>We are still waiting for our true Champion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there we have it.  Does the alt-right just love and adore Peterson?<br />
Hahaha. No.<br />
Not at all.</p>
<p>I'm sure some people in response will try to dredge up someone somewhere from the alt-right supporting Peterson
for his self-help message or just on the basis &quot;the enemy of my enemy&quot;. But that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Because the claim that many in the media have continually made is not
&quot;All the big names in the Alt Right don't like peterson but some alt-right supporters like Peterson anyways&quot;.
No-no-no-no-no.</p>
<p>They claim &quot;the alt-right looooooves Peterson&quot;.  That he is their <em>favorite</em>, their <em>belle</em>.<br />
And this proves that it is <em>demonstrably</em> untrue.</p>
<p>But just as it's completely unfair of media outlets to label Peterson in this way,
it would be unfair of me to label <em>all</em> media outlets as participating in this behavior.
There are many mainstream media outlets, even ones critical of Peterson that do not resort to such tactics.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not unusual to see different journalists in the same publication to have completely differnt ideas on Jordan Peterson.
Remember, it was New York Times that both published Bari Weiss's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html" title="Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web">&quot;Intellectual Dark Web&quot;</a> piece and one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html" title="Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy">the most ridiculous hit-jobs on Peterson</a>.</p>
<p>Each organization is not a monolith, and even though it's easy for us to see the world in these black and white terms, as many authors of these articles have.
We must always strive to understand the often complex nature of the world and judge people on their individual behavior, not on the group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[JBP] The idea of group rights is extraordinarily problematic, because the obverse of the coin of individual rights is individual responsibilities.
And you can hold an individual responsible, and an individual <em>can</em> be responsible, and so that's partly why individuals have rights.
But groups?  How do you hold a group responsible?  I mean, the whole idea is not a good idea to hold a group responsible.
First of all, it flies in the face of the idea of justice systems that we've laid out in the west that are essentially predicated first on the assumption of individual innocence,
but also on a possibility of individual guilt, not group guilt.  We saw what happened in the 20th century many-many times when the idea of group guilt was enabled
to get a foothold in the polity and then the justice system.  It was absolutely catastrophic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Sean] -- I hope we didn't just butt heads the whole time.</p>
<p>[JBP] -- I don't think so.  I mean, these aren't straightforward issues and they're going to cause some heat an noise when they're ironed out.
Conversations don't have to be easy to be worthwile.</p>
