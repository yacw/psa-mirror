<h1>Jordy Potterson And The Cucks Of Canuckistan</h1>
<p>By <em>Emmanuel Spraguer</em> 2018-03-18</p>
<h2>Jordan Peterson is a cultured, sophisticated man, but much of human affairs occurs on a much more primitive, visceral level.</h2>
<h3>Trying to teach certain non-white populations to not think tribally is like trying to teach a hippopotamus ballet. OK, perhaps this analogy takes it a bit far, but the spirit of the claim is nonetheless substantially true. Many non-white populations have only ever thought and behaved tribally.</h3>
<p>Many non-white groups don’t seem to possess the intellect or the introspective capacity to appreciate their own hypocrisy when it comes to issues of race (or any issue near and dear to them). And while I don’t wish to claim that it is impossible to make desert people, Melanesians, and Sub-Saharans into modestly objective thinkers on average or in sizable numbers, <em>the evidence that it is possible is</em> <em>really</em> <em>just not there</em>. There is every reason to believe that, in general, as populations, they haven’t the cognitive means to think like we do.</p>

<p>Jordan Peterson, famed Canadian professor, and self-proclaimed classical liberal, claims to be trying to save the West from identity politics. Not to put too fine a point on it, his attempts are laughably futile. In a recent interview, Peterson even claimed that he has “irrefutable evidence that [he has] pulled thousands of young men away from the attractions of the Alt-Right”. Being the consummate empiricist that he is, he has released none of this supposed evidence and almost certainly never will. I think he believes that if he proves to the regressive leftists and Cultural Marxists running the Western World that he is combating hate, and is in some sense their ally, they will leave him be and not persecute him for his ideas. He’s probably wrong on that account anyhow, but even if he is right, his messianic mission is still both misguided and pointless.</p>

<p>There is no way to make right-thinking white people not see what is being done to them by their pathologically anti-white overlords, the way they are being dispossessed, their lands invaded, their heroes denigrated, their way of life eradicated via mass-migration from the 3rd World. It is as incontrovertible as the sky is blue. The media can’t even hide the truth from common numbskulls any longer, despite its abyssal desire to do so. Our elites, even our own governments, which are supposed to represent us, are waging a war against our people. As whites continue to lose numbers and power, as we are vilified and marginalized and discriminated against ever more, whites young and old, but especially young, will flock to the Alt-Right to defend themselves, their families and their civilization from their racial and ideological (also usually racial) enemies, who despise them and long to do them harm by whatever means necessary. There is no way to put the Alt-Right back in the bag. We are a cultural and ideological force to be reckoned with, because identity politics are here, and here to stay. Diversity guarantees it.</p>
<p><img src="Britaincolor-300x210.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now I don’t know if the existence of identity politics is or isn’t morally ideal, and frankly, I don’t really care. <em>Tribal wars must be fought tribally.</em> So long as out-ethnic populations are trying to destroy us, to pull our land, our wealth, and our future out from under us, we must come together as a people to defend our interests. We can not effectively defend ourselves as atomized individuals or as quixotic ideologues squabbling amongst ourselves. It doesn’t work, neither in elections nor in war. We must come together as a race or we will surely perish.</p>
<p>Tribal conflicts require tribal solutions. There is no way to battle cohesive groups, which is to say other tribes behaving tribally, as many of them unwaveringly do, except as a cohesive group. Groups that want to replace us with their own via diversity quotas are obviously not concerned about racial discrimination, they are concerned about their own race receiving its perceived due and proper. Ethics and ethical consistency do not factor into the equation for such types. Reasoning with them is not fruitful. We must have the numbers and the cohesion to protect ourselves, or we will find ourselves beneath their boot. Southern whites, for example, vote cohesively out of necessity. If they didn’t, then the 35% black population of the American South, which does vote as a cohesive racial bloc, would outvote them in every election. They would live under the yoke of 80-IQ imbeciles year in, year out. It’d be like California, minus Silicon Valley. Deliberately spreading AIDS would be the legal equivalent of a traffic infraction.</p>
<p>As America diversifies, whites in the rest of the nation will increasingly find themselves in the same demographic predicament as Southerners, and will respond accordingly. <em>Tribalism is the only rational response to a tribal world.</em> There is no other practical way to protect one’s interests from groups attempting to advance their own interests, as groups. The Western World wasn’t always markedly tribal, but it sure is now, owing to increased ethnic, religious, genetic, and cultural difference, and there is little Jordan Peterson can do about that. When differences between populations are sufficiently small or when groups can be assimilated to a significant degree into a dominant culture, a society need not fracture along populational (racial, religious) lines. However, when group differences are large enough or when populations can not or will not assimilate on the group level (take for instance blacks in America or Arabs in Europe or Uyghurs in China) populational conflict and alienation are inevitable. Under more ideal social and economic conditions, these divisions and tensions can often be managed, but we do not enjoy such conditions any longer in the West.</p>

<p>So, Jordan Peterson can curse the heavens, he can demonize us and denigrate us all he pleases, he can charge us with “racism” and blasphemy against the gods of diversity, he can whine and wail and blow every journalist who interviews him, but we in the Alt-Right are the future. So let him saunter on back to his ivory tower and write a novel about how he is saving the youth from possessing a healthy race pride and sense of self, but the reality is classical liberalism and extreme individualism are only possible in a certain type of society, one that isn’t socially unstable and morally unmoored, one where social trust exists aplenty, where invading hordes aren’t raping young white children en masse, while a corrupt, totalitarian government helps them cover it up to keep the peace. Jordan Peterson, you see, owes his very existence to white, Western society, to the kind of society Alt-Righters long to once again create. In that sense, Jordan Peterson could never deliver us. The very notion is preposterous. It is we, the Alt-Right, who deliver the Jordan Petersons of the world. We are the soil and the sunlight of the West. Upon us her beauty wholly depends.</p>
