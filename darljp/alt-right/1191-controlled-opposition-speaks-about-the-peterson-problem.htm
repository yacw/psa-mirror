<h5><em>Most regular  readers know that Brandon and I have <a href="/index.php/cohencidence/nom-de-plume-s">history</a>. That said, the last few articles of his have been pretty good or the ones I have reposted here, anyway. He has become fixated on the &quot;evil white female&quot; issue which I think is silly to mix in with the JQ. Many resistance fighters would give Peterson slack for him boning (Peterson) off of Jews.</em></h5>
<h5><em>Sorry, I can't see that in blanket defamations of the new terrorists in town (racialist whites) while saying Jews are hated because they are better than everyone else, it to be anything short of traitorous and counter-productive.</em></h5>
<h5><em>Let us not be so desperate for a bone that we let them steal our house to get it. I can stand with Brandon on this issue. With allies like Peterson, who needs actual Bolsheviks?<img src="/images/1_Kep1IfUKu3tWCgLpOBvYPg.jpeg" alt="1 Kep1IfUKu3tWCgLpOBvYPg" /></em></h5>

<p>Alt-light gatekeeper Jordan Peterson makes nearly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/d7pe7z/controversial-u-of-t-professor-doubles-income-with-patreon-account">$200,000 a year from donations</a>. He’s raking in the Patreon beta bucks by telling people that free speech is good and that SJWs are insane – things any rational person can observe for themselves. These classical liberal cucks have found a niche market in feigning mild opposition to out-of-control social justice warriors, milking impressionable young men for pointing out the obvious absurdity of the radical left.</p>
<p>Peterson has had many opportunities to tell the truth about the problem of Jewish power, but on every occasion has failed the litmus test. Instead of rightly criticizing the monstrous effects of Jewish power, Peterson has justified their power with IQ arguments, stating that they deserve to rule us because they’re just smarter than the rest. Ashkenazi Jews are most likely no smarter than white Gentiles on average, so that doesn’t explain their extreme overrepresentation in powerful institutions, considering their tiny numbers. Nepotism explains it, however.</p>
<p>Once again Peterson was confronted with the Jewish question at a public event. This time the Jewish role in Bolshevism was put to him. The questioner observed that Bolshevism was an ideology and regime spawned by ethnic Jews who harboured a murderous hatred of white Christians. He gave Peterson a copy of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s “200 Years Together,” which discusses the Jewish role in Russian Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Peterson’s response: “I can’t do it.”</p>
<p>Peterson is a cowardly disgrace. On the most important issue of our time, Peterson ducks, dives and dodges to avoid the truth. Even the man informing him about Jewish Bolshevism was Jewish himself. If a Jew is willing to call out other Jews, why is Peterson so reluctant? Because he’s more interested in making money than addressing profound issues. He wants to appear edgy enough to piss off radical leftists and SJWs, winning him right-wing fans across the board. But he doesn’t want to be too edgy where he upsets the powerful Jews whose media he relies on for publicity. If he wants to keep making bank, he must appear on mainstream media as the acceptable dissident against the lunatic left. He is Jewry’s controlled opposition choice to lead dissent against leftism astray, away from the JQ.</p>
<p>It’s abundantly clear now that classical liberals like Peterson are either wittingly or unwittingly in the pay of Jews. These fakers steal arguments from the alt-right while rejecting the more controversial truths on race and the Jewish question. By siphoning off potential support for the alt-right and redirecting it into Jew-friendly individualist ideology, this classical liberal clique does Jewry’s work to defang the right-wing backlash to globalism, leftism and the multicultural experiment.</p>
<p>We need to continue unmasking these shills, exposing their half-truths and lies.</p>
