<h1>Canada: Jewish controlled opposition: Jordan Peterson is a Piece of Shit – He might be a Jew in disguise</h1>
<p>By <em>jlamprecht</em> 2018-05-10</p>
<p>[Professor Jordan Peterson came to my attention some time back. One of my Canadian NAZI friends raved about him. So I went and watched several short videos where he talks. I went back to my Canadian NAZI friend and said that Jordan Peterson HATES GERMANS! He is basically pushing the same hatred of Germans that Jews do, and I could not see why a serious NAZI (National Socialist) should be listening to him.</p>
<p>Then I had my Boer NAZI pal take a look at him, and he was a lecturer in scientific method at university. He gave me his reasons why Peterson might even be a JEW. I take my Boer NAZI pal seriously, and the more I’ve thought about it the more I think he’s on to something.</p>
<p>Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer originally detested Peterson too. In January 2018, he had an article titled: “Seven Hour Video on Why Jordan Peterson is a Piece of Shit”. But then in April 2018, he said this: “I was wrong about Jordan B. Peterson. He’s one of us.”.</p>
<p>I think Andrew has been fooled by the chameleon characteristics of a Jew at work. From the videos I’d watched of Peterson, and the things he teaches his students I’d concluded that no ways in HELL is this guy one of us.</p>
<p>Smoloko’s Scottie (who is still missing), also thought that the Alt-Right/Alt-Light is wrong about Peterson. He regarded him as controlled Zionist opposition.</p>
<p>I’m sticking with my own assessment and that of my Boer NAZI pal, that we’re very likely dealing even with a Jew in disguise and no ways in HELL is this guy anywhere near our values. I’ve listened to what he’s said, and this guy is not even close to being what we are.</p>
<p>I will discuss Peterson later. But my view is firm, this is a piece of shit, and very possibly a Jew in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>The quote at the top of this article of mine (“Evil is the force that believes its knowledge is complete”)  is already an indication of the direction Dr Jordan Peterson is going in misleading you. That sort of argument, extrapolated is used to attack someone like Hitler for example. This is just Jewish thinking disguised to fool people and to misdirect you back to the Jewish agenda. See the Kermit nonsense below. Its also a stupid Jewish mind game.</strong> Jan]</p>
