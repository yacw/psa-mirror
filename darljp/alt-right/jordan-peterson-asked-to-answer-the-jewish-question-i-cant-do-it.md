# Jordan Peterson Asked to Answer the Jewish Question: “I Can’t Do It”

On Tuesday, the 23rd of January, Jordan Peterson was confronted in New York City with a copy of the newly translated “200 Years Together” by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a Russian author who wrote about the Jewish role in the Bolshevik revolution and the overwhelming Jewish hatred for white Christian Russians.

The audience member questioning Peterson brings up the Holodomor, a genocide of Ukrainians, and says that this was driven by Jewish hatred for white Christians.

He says that the same Jews who acted out of genocidal mania against Russians during the communist era are now running the Western media and are spewing the same type of vile hatred for the Russian people.

He then asks Peterson: “Could Jewish individuals use their positions of power to seek out revenge against placed like Europe and Russia that have a history of expelling Jews?

Peterson wavers and walks back and forth across the stage, talking about how he’ll read the book before eventually saying: “I can’t do it.”

So, there you have it.

The big brave anti-feminist, the hero of the Alt-Lite movement, is totally incapable of even speaking a sentence on the issue of Jewish power. His only response is to claim he does not have the ability to do so.

This is incredible.

Peterson says some simple, basic things about feminism and male identity – the same things I’ve been saying for 5 years on this site – then mixes it up with some semi-interesting rehashings of Karl Jung and Joseph Campbell, and the whole internet fawns over him.

But on the most basic and fundamental problem – J-E-W-S – he has not a single word.

This is the same pretentious, smarmy faggot who banned Faith Goldy from a speaking event – A “FREE SPEECH” SPEAKING EVENT – because she went on a Daily Stormer podcast with Azzmador after Charlottesville. When he was asked about that, he went into a gay little tizzy while faking a cool composure.

He then gave another bullshit answer.

What could the coward Peterson say, other than “I am a coward”?

Instead he gives you gibberish: “they are bad evil people, so you have to confront them on how evil they are, and she didn’t do that so she is also evil and has to BE TAKEN OUT.”

This smarmy rat isn’t saying anything.

What good then is he?

And how much better are we than he?

## HERE’S THE PLAN, BOYS

Here’s the plan: get tickets to this man’s shows by any means necessary and press him on the question. Ask him why it is that he “CAN’T DO IT” when it comes to the Jewish question, but is somehow able to claim intellectual honesty.

Call him out as a charlatan who is making millions off of feeding basic simple truths to kids who are starving for any truth at all, while purposefully hiding from them the most important truths of what we are facing as a civilization.

YOU HAVE A DUTY.

WHEN HE COMES TO YOUR TOWN, GET IN THE AUDIENCE, GET IN LINE, AND ASK HIM: WHY ARE YOU REFUSING TO TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM? WHAT IS YOUR AGENDA THAT YOU ARE PURPOSEFULLY COVERING UP FOR THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE?
