<h1>An alt-right case against Jordan Peterson</h1>
<p>By <em>alternativeeugene</em> 2018-04-02</p>
<p>I have written several times <a href="#https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2018/03/03/an-altright-case-for-jordan-peterson/">in favor</a> of <a href="#https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2018/02/18/jordan-peterson-is-the-new-leader-of-the-alt-right/">Jordan Peterson</a>, including advocating him as the champion of dissident politics. I believe he can be the person who bridges the mainstream and the dissident to a satisfactory level.</p>
<p>I advocate for him primarily because he’s a person of sterling character. That he is also intelligent and capable is secondary. Tertiary is that he offers a normie palatable platform that would, if enacted, necessitate the destruction of the regressive left. The solution Jordan Peterson proposes is a suitable compromise to stop the rapid and deliberate destruction of Western society, and appears to have the potential to gain mass support.</p>
<p>Despite this much of the alt-right has decided they don’t much like him.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with members of dissident politics is their inability to recognize and appreciate fellow travelers. Everyone has to be as far as them or else they will counter signal. I believe Milo Yiannapoulis is ideally suited to reach out to disaffected normie college students as a champion against insane leftism who still need caveats like “he’s gay!” to be able to entertain the badthink. In emails that came out, it became clear Milo was much more redpill than he let on. But he weighed his options and decided against publicly revealing his true power level. I have always believed there is a place for that. If you start ranting about the Jews and Hitler being right, you might as well try to win people over to cannibalism or pedophilia. Once you have got someone to reject insane tenets of leftism they will be willing to reject more fundamental tenets of leftism and later come to reject leftism all together. It doesn’t really work backwards. Milo is not stealing any Richard Spencer fans.</p>
<p>I applied the same principle to Jordan Peterson. Whichever leader rises up and looks as if they might lead you to victory then it’s better to follow them than to champion more ideologically compatible leaders who have no chance of winning.</p>
<p>That being said, there are valid criticisms of his philosophy, and unlike Milo he looks very capable of co-opting the entire dissident movement.</p>
<p>Peterson’s philosophy being more normie-friendly necessarily makes it less reality-friendly. He recently wrote a post “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180323145141/http://jordanbpeterson.com/psychology/on-the-so-called-jewish-question/">addressing the so-called Jewish Question</a>.” I wrote a <a href="#https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2017/12/15/why-are-so-many-of-the-accused-jewish/">fairly cucky</a> post on the JQ, but not as cucky as him. The unfortunate part about his philosophy appears that he actually believes it. Unlike Milo, we cannot expect Peterson to go harder if given the chance. He will not address the uglier questions. He will tell whites not to act as a collective as the rest of the world acts cohesively on identity.</p>
<p>At some point, the Nation needs to act in its own interests. We are in a struggle for survival. America was nearly 90% white when Peterson was born. It will be less than half when he dies. The people listening to Peterson are white middle class males. They are not the ones who need to be taught to cooperate and consider others interests. If we can get any sign of the real racial warriors putting down their arms we will be more than happy to put down ours. Until then, our strategy of disarmament has been like a boxer refusing to put his gloves up.</p>
<p>One of Peterson’s favorite phrases is that there is more difference among individuals within groups than between groups. Or something like that. I don’t know what solution he proposes to the 40 million Mexicans in the US who act as a group. Or the various sub-actors in the West acting as groups. He thinks Jewish over-representation is solely attributable to IQ, ignoring the math and nepotism.</p>
<p>If enacted, Petersonism will stop the alt-left. He will rally normie college kids to anti-left policies. He boldly stands up and calls out the Marxification of campuses. He even offers solutions. But the cancer is very advanced. Population replacement will continue without the alt-left. They are merely the tools of the politicians and corporations.</p>
<p>Peterson has no interest in the alt right or its more controversial truths. He has an interest in stopping identity politics and fringe leftism. If he gets his way, we all win, but his winning would be more of a temporary reprieve, like Trump. We are still waiting for our true Champion.</p>
