# An alt-right case for Jordan Peterson

By *alternativeeugene* 2018-03-03

I [wrote before](#https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2018/02/18/jordan-peterson-is-the-new-leader-of-the-alt-right/) how Jordan Peterson is becoming a gelling point for dissident thinkers. He’s better than any other dissident public intellectual. Richard Spencer? Andrew Anglin? If you have to wonder whether someone is an FBI plant, that should tell you how viable they are. Someone like Spencer or Anglin should be no more than a jester to entertain the troops. If you put them out there to weather the storms and face the public what do you expect? Could there be a more uphill climb than trying to win people over by sig-heiling and nonstop racial humor? Stormfront has existed for a very long time. It hasn’t changed any public perceptions of it.

And frankly, listen to these fucking losers.

A lot of the alt-right has a big problem with Peterson. These guys are like two steps above soyboys. They’re just dudes. The kind of people who only exist because it’s a very ‘small pond’. The more I compare Peterson to the options offered by the alt-right sphere, the better he looks. Now, there are great thinkers, people far more unflinching in the face of harsher truths than Peterson within that realm. But I haven’t seen any of them bitch about Peterson. Quality recognizes quality. What dumbass Nazi Mike and the Boys fail to realize is that they offer nothing besides playing grabass with others who are already of like opinions.

We presently have enough momentum that people will try all kinds of things and get success. It’s like the tech boom. People are hungry for new options. But we need to identify the ebays and googles, not the [boo.coms](#https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/10/27/17-dot-com-failures-and-their-modern-counterparts/).

Jordan Peterson is a hit. Embracing him does not share the risk Richard Spencer does. To gain momentum you need to win over disaffected normies. People who have jobs and lives and things to lose and don’t want to step out as nazis. Many went to Bernie. But the more spirited will naturally respond to Peterson’s message. Instead of being told they are owed other people’s shit, Peterson denounces those types and says you are your own master. This is a message for white men who are looking to restore their image and value in the West. White men do not need to hear they are owed other people’s shit. Equality of opportunity is all we need. The nature of things being that in a society of “equality of opportunity” it will eventually become very White and very Male all the way to the top, to exactly the degree deserved.

This is why the SJWs hate him and call him a nazi. A generation or two of equality of opportunity will be a return to white patriarchal society. Ghetto blacks and Muslim women won’t be a threat without someone picking the pockets of white and Asian males for them.

Equality of opportunity is the great rallying cry of the movement forward. Palatable to white males who have had every other form of self interest turned poisonous. Any basic redditor can get behind it. There is no credible ground on which to oppose it. No argument that doesn’t make you look like an asshole.

SJWs are right to oppose Peterson because they see their death in his position. But they haven’t been able to dismiss and destroy him. His innocuousness makes them look worse for trying. His position can appear to be inoffensive reform. But its implementations would destroy the entire SJW edifice. Individualism cannot coexist with Marxism. One must squeeze the other out. Whichever tips the balances in its favor will cause the decline of the other. If we can begin to destroy Marxism all these other issues will fade away. Like a fat girl who loses weight and notices that 80% of her other problems magically vanish. SJWism is the heart of the dragon. And Peterson is /ourguy/ to slay it.
