<h2><a href="#intro" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="intro"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>Words have power.  They shape the way we think about the world.
And they often have emotions embedded within them.  Emotions attached to the concepts they represent.
Because of this, words are carefully selected by those trying to persuade you, or perhaps even manipulate you.</p>
<p>We see this ofthen in politics.  The negative term &quot;flip-flop&quot; is repranded to the nicer-sounding &quot;pivot&quot;.
The boring term &quot;estate tax&quot; is rebranded as the &quot;death tax&quot;.
Though with these examples, in order to influence the desired emotion, different words are used.</p>
<p>But now we're entering the new phase -- a far more dangerous phase, where instead of group rebranding an idea, <!-- triangular trade clip -->
they're attemptying to redefine the word itself.
The most notable example of this in fiction is in 1984, where the authoritarian ruling party created a new language in order to change the way people thought and could communicate their feelings.
It was called Newspeak.
One example, as Jeorge Orwell described the word &quot;free&quot; still existed in the Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as
&quot;This dog is free from lice.&quot; or &quot;This field is free from weeds.&quot;
It could not be used in its old sense of &quot;politically free&quot; or &quot;intellectually free&quot;, since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts.</p>
<p>Now, their redefining or limiting of what the word &quot;free&quot; meant was in order to push an ideological agend.
And in this video I will show you how the same thing is occurring today with the word &quot;racism&quot;.</p>
<p>And it's not my interpretation or opinion that this attempt is ideologically drive and not in good faith.
I will show you how the individuals who created and pushed for this redefinition were very explicit and open about their intentions and motivations.</p>
<h2><a href="#academic-definition" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="academic-definition"></a>Academic Definition</h2>
<p>You may have been in the situation where you've seen someone on the internet say something like: <em>All white people suck, please retweet</em></p>
<p>And you say: <strong>&lt;Objection!&gt;</strong>, that's racist.</p>
<p>To which they reply: <em>Racism against white people is impossible because racism equals prejudice plus power</em></p>
<p><em>Well, the dictionary defines racism as hatred or intolerance of another race or races.</em></p>
<p>To which they say: <em>This is the academic definition, and therefore it makes it better</em></p>
<p>But you see, the thing is, it's not actually the &quot;academic&quot; definition as people like to claim.
Not ignoring, of course that the broad term &quot;academic&quot; could mean literally anything.
But saying &quot;academic&quot; gives it a little more weight than saying &quot;the sociological definition&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to understand racism, you need to talk sociology.
And sociology explains racism as combination of prejudice plus power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, most of us will accept this, since sociology is a study of groups and wouldn't be too shocking if a field about groups defined racism in a purely group settings.</p>
<p>But you see, the funny thing is...  It's not the official sociological definition either!</p>
<p>And now I present to you, a montage of sociological textbooks not defining racism as &quot;Power + Prejudice&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And before you accuse me of cherry-picking... well, at this point I might as well be cherry-<strong>forest</strong>-picking,
I found only one.  <em>One.</em>  <strong>Oooone</strong> source that was not a individual person's research paper or article.
Only one that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cambrige Dictionary of Sociology by <em>Bryan S. Turner</em></p>
<p>Finally, racism refers to the overall relations of domination and subdomination between groups
that flow from the hierarchical structuring of a given society based on racial distinctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which sort of sounds similar to P+P=R.  But even they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sociology, where the distinction between race and ethnicity is uncertain,
it is best to limit &quot;racism&quot; to structures in which race is explicitly used to effect social domination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how it says &quot;in sociology&quot;. They're very clearly limiting this to their specific area of study.</p>
<p>I mean, they also define rationalization as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The historical development of institutional orders such as the law, the market, capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of, you know, the lie you feed yourself when you try to justify something that you know is wrong.
And I don't hear anyone advocating for changing the general definition of &quot;rationalisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Now you may have noticed that all the definitions I found were from introductory or general sociology textbooks.
And there's a reason for that: it's because there's a lot of disagreement in the field of sociology on how to study, define, or even understand the concept of racism.
And we'll be getting into that argument later.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-real-origin" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-real-origin"></a>The Real Origin</h2>
<p>So the question arises: if it's not an &quot;academic&quot; definition, and it's not the official sociology definition, what is it?</p>
<p>Well, sit on down, boy and girls and let uncle Sitch to tell you the tale of P+P=R.</p>
<p>Our story begins in the 1940s, where all internet stories begin, with the nazis!
People were sitting around, saying: Hey guys, we need to word to describe how
the white nazis went around trying to kill white jews and other white europeans.
What should we call this ideology of judging people based on what we consider &quot;race&quot;.</p>
<p>Uuuuuuuuh... Race... -ism?</p>
<p>And thus the term racism was born.
Yes, that's right, the term &quot;racism&quot; didn't come out of the 100+ years of horrendous enslavement,
torture and murder of africans and their ancestors by white people.
No!  It came out of the half decade of horrendous enslavement, torture and murder of white people by other white people.
So, you know, #WhitePeopleProblems.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is important for couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It shows how P+P=R is insufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because a lot of the jews in Germany, before the nazis took over, were economically well off.
They had power.  That's part of how the nazis got other germans to turn on the jews.
They labeled them as privileged oppressor keeping other germands down.</p>
<p>So the jews <em>had</em> power in Germany.  You know, until they didn't</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This explains why the word &quot;racist&quot; in America is so powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the word was created to describe white people discriminating against and oppressing black people,
do you think that white bigots in the 40's and 50's who didn't want to give black people equal rights would <em>care</em> if you called them racist?
Of course not.  <em>That's the point of the thing,</em> to openly discriminate against black people.</p>
<p>No, people cared because calling someone a racist was like calling someone a <strong>nazi</strong>.
Yes, that's right folks, calling someone a racist was the original Godwin's law.
And since americans were, you know, pretty anti-nazi because of the whole <em>World War</em> and <em>mass genocide</em> thing,
the term &quot;racist&quot; had power behind it.</p>
<p>So where does the world's worst meme come from?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dabbing+on+them+haters" title="Dabbing on them haters">Dabbing on them haters</a></p>
<p>Okay, second worst meme.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1357/" title="xkcd: Free Speech">xkcd: Free Speech</a></p>
<p><strong>Third</strong> worst...</p>
<p>It's the 70's. It's right after that little thing you might have heard of called &quot;The Civil Rights Movement&quot;.
Black people in America were finally granted equal protection under the law as white people.  Yaaay!</p>
<p>So that means racism completely disappeared and all people live together in perfect utopian haromny, right?</p>
<p>Bwa-ha-ha-ha ha... No.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, racists aren't like Tinkerbell.  When you stop beliving they exist, they don't suddenly disappear.
Because any wide-spread cultural shift takes time.
Especially one rooted in the systemic enslavement and discrimination and oppression of people for hundreds of years.
So some people were looking for way to speed up the process.  On the whole &quot;getting rid of the racism thing&quot;.
This lead to many sociologists and psychologists arguing about the black community.</p>
<p>So enter the lady named Patricia Bidol, who at the time was a superintendent of a school district in Michigan.
And she looked at the situation and said: &quot;the way to combat racism is through teaching&quot;, so she created a teaching manual
called &quot;Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-media Social Studies <em>Curriculum</em> in Racism Awareness for the Secondary Level&quot;.
Quite the mouthfull.  And this, my friends, is where P+P=R originated.</p>
<p>Now you may think, it's a <em>little strange</em> that the supposed &quot;academic&quot; definition didn't originate in the academic or research paper.
Instead it came from a <em>curriculum</em>.  You see, when the topic of the black community sufferring from the effects of racism came up,
detractors of progressive policies would often say:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black people have equal rights and protections now.  Any fault they suffer is their own.</li>
<li>I'm not racist.  I'm in favor of equal rights, but I'm just a blue-collar working white guy,
struggling to get by like everyone else.  I have nothing to do with any of that racist stuff.</li>
<li>Affirmative actions judge people by skin color, so they're all racist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bidol did not only believe that these arguments would get in the way of white people actively fighting against racism,
but fully expected that teachers being forced to sit through her education program would
bring up these points in an attempt to fight against anti-racist training.
So what did Bidol and similar-minded people of that time do?</p>
<p>They just said: &quot;Fuck it!&quot;  Flip the proverbial table over, and decided to redefine the word racism in a way so that the definition itself would counter these common arguments.</p>
<p>They redefined &quot;racism&quot; to mean</p>
<ol>
<li>Because the American system is historically rooted in racism, today's system is still ingrained in racism.</li>
<li>All white people are inherently racist regardless of what they think as individuals, simply because they benefit from being white in America.</li>
<li>Affirmative action is not racist because I've arbitrarily decided that racism refers only to systemic action, and not to one's individual prejudice.
That way, only white people can be racist.</li>
</ol>
<p>So P+P=R was created with the express purpose of winning an ideological argument.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that again:</p>
<h3><a href="#pp=r-was-created-with-the-express-purpose-of-winning-an-ideological-argument." aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="pp=r-was-created-with-the-express-purpose-of-winning-an-ideological-argument."></a>P+P=R was created with the express purpose of winning an ideological argument.</h3>
<p>Now I want to make it clear: I'm not saying that the initial arguments are correct,
but they are arguments people were making, and you want to combat them, you must do so with facts and logic, and all of that good stuff.
Not just simply say <em>&quot;Loool, I just simply redefine the word so I'm automatically right, and you're automatically wrong&quot;</em>.
That's not how civil discrouse works.</p>
<p>Now, let me show you exactly what I'm talking about.
In 1973 Bidol and several others worked on the &quot;Education &amp; Racism: An Action Manual&quot;
To get a good idea of where her mindset was, we only have to look at the preface:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="#preface" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="preface"></a>Preface</h2>
<p>&quot;If you're not part of the solution, you must be part of the problem.&quot;
White educators in the United States to whom this report is addressed, are
part of the problem.  For too long we, as whites, have failed to explore what
it means to be white in a white racist society.  As long as we fail to examine
our motives in the area of face relations, especially the implications of white
privilege, the status quo of white racism will be maintained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, again, this is important to remember that this was written in 1973, when things were definitely a lot more racist.
So I don't want to fall into the trap of judging the people writing this through the way in which society is today.
But by the same token, it's wrong for people to use the same ideology that was created in a very different time period
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Holy Bible">try to explain or justify things that are happening today</a>.
Again, we could see that the express purpose is to motivate action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is racism?  &quot;Racism is racial prejudice (the belief that one's own race is superior to other race)
combined with the power to enforce this bias throughout the institutions and culture of a society.&quot;<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Bidol, Pat A. <em>Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-Media Socail Studied Curriculum in Race Relations for the Secondary Level.</em>
Revised edition.  Detroid: New Perspectives on Race, Inc., 1972. p. 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you see them repeat the P+P=R and they cite Bidol, which is unsurprising, <em>considering she worked on this</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major institutions of our society reinforce white racial prejudice because we have
whites control the decision-making and standard-setting process of these institutions.
Thus white-originated standards become normative, resulting in benefits for whites
just because they are white and in the oppression of blacks and other Third World people
because they are not white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, later, we're going to get into how incredibly racist it is to believe that black people need different standards than white people.
But for now, let's just keep that in the back of our mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our major institutions is the public school.  The schools (and we as educators)
are supposed to transmit our beliefs about ourselves as a nation (the pluralistic, democratic,
egalitarian ideology of our national self-concept) as well as the knowledge and skills necessary to survive,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this fringe group of people were trying to run this idea that all white people are inherently racist and P+P=R into our public school system in the 70's.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Until our motivations in the area of race relations, especially the implications of white privilege, can be consciously examined, the status quo will be maintained.
To eliminate racism from our society will require an examination and reorientation of our goals and priorities.
Effective reorientation will require education concerning the nature, practices, and effects of racism.
Whites will have to develop a new self-concept which will allow us to affirm ourselves without having to do so
by oppressing Third World people.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, for some reason back then, or at least in this report, they decided that calling people of color &quot;Third World people&quot; was Politically Correct thing to do.
I know, it doesn't make sense to me either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we were to work on the elimination of racism from our society it is advisable that we work from a commonly agreed-upon set of definitions.
What follows is a set of meaning sthat provide on such common base and have proved accurate and helpful for several years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can clearly see that P+P=R's motivation is based around this idea of getting white people to reorient and develop
this new self-concept of what it means to be white, and how all white people in America are inherently racist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>School systems reinforce white images and maintain the &quot;rightness of whiteness&quot; syndrome through curriculum materials.
In very subtle ways white aspirations, norms, and values are held out this textbook, for example,
at materials stressing the importance of eating three well balanced meals a day.
The meals illustrated are white middle class meals, served as viwed appropriate
by white standards and consisting of foods selected by whites as desirable.
Black and Third World youngsters cannot identify with that image and can only regard their
parents as failing them in some important way because they don't serve those same foods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of course we all know what constitutes healthy food apparently changes on your skin color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one is suggesting that we get rid of white Santa Clauses, white historical heroes, white myths, or white fairy tales,
for these are essential to the development of a healthy self-concept for white youth.
What we must do, if we are to eliminate cultural racism, is to supply additional symbols,
myths, heroes, and holidays with which black and Third World youngsters can identify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gos into this whole far-left notion that I <em>vehemently</em> disagree with.
The whole thing, ironically enough, sounds like &quot;separate but equal&quot;.
What we <em>should be</em> pushing for in America is shockingly an American identity, not a racial or ethnic one.</p>
<p>This idea actually goes far further than today's critics that want more biological-based diversity in media, government and business.
This ideology promotes the motion that American values are actually white values,
And that all people have and should be taught a different value system.
This whole idea is the soft bigotry of low expectations.
Just look at the next part:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="#pitfalls-to-avoid" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="pitfalls-to-avoid"></a>Pitfalls To Avoid</h2>
<p>One is a tendency to &quot;blame the victim&quot; for his circumstances, even after carefully analyzing
these circumstances and agreeing what whites have systematically repressed an oppressed Third World peoples.
A good example of this tendency can be found in the famous Kerner Report, which documented at lenth
how certain elements in our schools, such as IQ test, teacher expectations, counseling practices,
curriculum materials, and tracking systems, are based upon white
racist ideology and are underlying causes of racial tensions.
What solution did the report suggest?
That we keep the inner-city schools become like the suburban schools!
We have instituted massive federally funded compensatory education programs
designed to bring white values and norms to those whom we have cause to be
&quot;culturally deprived.&quot;  Such solutions are contradictory and racist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right, folks!  Trying to make poor schools like rich schools is blaming the victim because we're infecting black children with our dreaded black values and norms.
So not only have these people redefined American values as white values, but they're saying that teaching black kinds to live up to the same values and norms as white kids is <strong>racist.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="#becoming-antirasistracists" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="becoming-antirasistracists"></a>Becoming Antirasist/Racists</h2>
<p>As whites in a racist society we have only two behaviors to choose from
vis-a-vis the issue of racism.  We can choose to be racist/racists--those who
recognize the benefits accrued through being white and either consciously or
unconsciously support institutional and cultural practices that perpetuate racism.
Or we can choose to be antiracist/racists--those who recognize the illegitimate
priviliges obtained by whiteness but strive to remove these institutionally
and culturally racist benefits even while still receiving them.
There really is no place in between.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See?  Even if you're fighting your hardest to get rid of racism, you're still a racist.
Sorry guys, if there's no room for racists, whitey's gotta go.</p>
<p>Now I want to make it abundantly clear: I don't have a problem with people doing things or creating educational systems that are motivated by the desire to combat racism.
What I <em>do</em> have a problem with is trying to redefine a word in order to win an ideological argument.
There's a reason they chose the word &quot;racism&quot; to redefine instead of &quot;Racial Prejudice&quot;.
They're trying to piggy-back off of the already estabilished power the word &quot;racist&quot; has,
and suddenly insert a different meaning to trick people into following their ideas.</p>
<h2><a href="#judith-katz" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="judith-katz"></a>Judith Katz</h2>
<p>Now even though Bidol created the term, she wasn't the one who popularized it.
There are a few people who are mostly creditet with spreading P+P=R.
One of them is Judith Katz.  Katz was also not a sociologist, but had a doctorate in education.
Currently she's the executive vice-president and client brand lead of the Khalil Jameson consulting group.
It's one of those organisations that large businesses pay to put on meetings for employees where they tell them how to not be horribly racist and sexist.</p>
<p>In 1978 she wrote the &quot;<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=Katz+White+Awareness" title="White Awareness: A Handbook for Anti-Racism Training, Judith H. Katz">White Awarenees Handbook for anti-racism training</a>&quot;
And if you hadn't guessed from the title, this is like Bidol's work,
and it's not an academic paper, but it's literally a handbook for anti-racism training.
But let's delve into it to see what we can learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is, therefore, designed for White people. It is a means to help us break out of the oppressor role and take a step toward being more fully human.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Affirmative Action efforts are being met with cries of &quot;reverse discrimination.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's almost like they want to redefine racism just so they can win arguments against this point</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of these conditions and the state of our society today, it is essential to focus on racism
as it affects the oppressors namely, White people. This chapter will seek to establish the nature of racism
as a White problem, describe its effects on Whites both psychologically and intellectually,
and discuss the processes that are necessary to bring about change in the attitudes and behaviors of Whites.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cries of reverse discrimination by Whites have also helped turn back the tide of change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh, wouldn't it be convenient if someone just came along and defined racism in a way so that racism against white people or &quot;reverse racism&quot; didn't exist?
That would just be sooo helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note to facilitator</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Refer again to the definition of prejudice and differentiate it from racism.
By the end of this exercise these two terms should have distinct meanings for the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to push for the understanding that racism is prejudice plus power and that, therefore,
Third World people cannot be racist against Whites in the United States. Third World people can be prejudiced against Whites,
but clearly they do not have the power to enforce that prejudice.  Although participants may not at this point
totally accept this view or feel comfortable with it, it is important to establish the concept as a working definition.
As the course progresses, it will, it is hoped, be better understood by participants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite all the writings in the field, little has been published on racism as it affects Whites.
Few strategies or materials have been designed to raise the consciousness of White people,
to help them identify racism in themselves and others, or to develop skills to facilitate change in the White community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting to see a pattern here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, racism is a White problem in that its development and perpetuation rest with White people.
Whites created racism through the establishment of policies and practices that serve to their
advantage and benefit and continue to oppress all minorities in the United States.
Racism is perpetuated by Whites through their conscious and/or unconscious support of a culture
and institutions that are founded on racist policies and practices.
The racial prejudice of White people coupled with the economic, political, and social power to enforce
discriminatory practices on every level of life cultural, institutional, and individual is the gestalt of White racism.
Therefore, the &quot;race problem&quot; in America is essentially a <em>White</em> problem in that it is Whites who developed it, perpetuate it, and have the power to resolve it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Several authors have probed the disease more deeply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Katz and several authors at the time actually thought racism should be classified as a mental illness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wendell Berry (1970), a White, describes racism as a disease with which he has been
afflicted from birth and from which, though he is trying to overcome it, he suffers every day.</p>
<p>Racism has been diagnosed as a form of schizophrenia in that there is a large gap between what Whites believe
and what they actually practice, which causes them to live in a state of psychological stress</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>All these analyses clearly indicate that racism is a critical and pervasive form of mental illness.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Because United States culture is centered around White norms, White people rarely have to come to terms with that part of their identity.
Ask a White person his or her race, and you may get the response &quot;Italian,&quot; &quot;Jewish,'' &quot;Irish,'' &quot;English,&quot; and so on.
<em>White people do not see themselves as White.</em>  This is a way of denying responsibility for perpetuating the racist system
and being part of the problem.  By seeing oneself solely as an individual, one can disown one's racism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you can see the insane and anti-liberal hole that the alt-left have fallen into.
They've given up the hiveminded ideals of treating people as individuals and trying to achieve a colorblind society.
Because then you can claim you're not racist!</p>
<p>And they're so messed in the head they think peple will only care about racism if they can redefine reality so that all white people are automatically racist.
This is classic motivated reasoning.  Katz is very explicit with the intention to change the way white people change think about racism and themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From these studies it becomes sadly evident that the psychological disorder racism is deeply
imbedded in White people from a very early age on both a conscious and an unconscious level.
The disease has locked them in a psychological prison that victimizes and oppresses them every day of their lives (Barndt, 1970).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's pretty baffling that these people don't realize that in-group out-group preferences are biologically wired into your brain.
This isn't just a &quot;white person thing&quot;.  All humans must learn to not give into our basic instincts of racism.</p>
<p>Interesting this &quot;everything is a social construct&quot; theory actually denies humanity to people based on their skin color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White people as well as Third World people, have been miseducated about their true historical roots (Daniels, 1973).
James Weldon Johnson (1960), equating White with Anglo-Saxon, discussed the issue:</p>
<p>Can you name a single one of the great fundamental and intellectual achievements
which have raised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the Anglo-Saxon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, let's just discount all of the things white people did that weren't Anglo-Saxons...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The art of letters, of poetry, of music, of sculpture, of painting, of the drama,
of architecture; the science of mathematics, of astronomy, of philosophy,
of logic, of physics, of chemistry, the use of metals, and the principles of mechanics,
were all invented or discovered by darker and what we now call inferior races and nations...
Do you know that the only original contribution to civilization we can claim
is what we have done in steam and electricity and in making implements of war more deadly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all... it's hilarious that he's poo-pooing steam and electricity.
You know, <strong>the technologies that revolutionized the entire world</strong>.
Whatever, that's just not important at all.  Anglo-Saxons didn't do anything beyound that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Lois Paster, Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, William Shakespeare...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, nothing at all.</p>
<p>And look, I know Katz is quoting someone, but she decided to include this in a teaching handbook, that's pretty crazy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The need for reeducation of White people is stressed in a statement by the United States Commision of Civil Rights (1970):
&quot;The principal task of those white Americans combating racism lies with the white community, rather than within non-white communities&quot; (p. 39).</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Given the lack of techniques available to deal with White racism, and conclusion that systematic training produces desired results
(Authier, Gustafson, Guerney, and Kasdorf, 1975), it appears likely that this form of training can in fact
change White people's racist attitudes and behaviors.  Such a training program is presented in this book.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-to-use-this-program" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-to-use-this-program"></a>How to Use This Program</h2>
<p>The over-all objectives of the program are to help Whites become aware of how racism
affects their lives and to help them change their racist attitudes and behaviors.
The program strives to help Whites understand that racism in the United States
is a White problem and that being White implies being racist.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Unlike many racism awareness programs, this program is not designed to produce guilt
or to confront people in a way that &quot;puts them down.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm... sceptical of that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<p>The following assumptions form the basis of this training problem:</p>
<p><em>Racism is a predominantly White problem.</em>  Therefore, being white in America implies being racist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a hell of an assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White people are responsible for the perpetuation of White racism in a White racist system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether you agree or disagree with that statement, <em>I don't care</em>, because that's not the point.
The point is that P+P=R was created to serve this ideological purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stage 1 lays the groundwork for participants to understand racism in society and in themselves.
In this first stage, the key concepts prejudice and racism are explored.
The participants become aware of the reality that <em>power</em> is the major factor differentiating racism and prejudice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Becoming aware&quot; is a nice way of saying &quot;making people accept our redefinition of the word&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are using Stage 1 experiences only, it is essential to go slowly and avoid making participants defensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This something I'd expect to hear a pick-up artist say...</p>
<p>&quot;So when you're in the classroom and you see a fine-looking girl you want to reeducate
on the systemic structures of racism and her implicit biases.
You gotta take it slooow.  You want to approach her confidently.
But you can't call her a racist, that will only scare her off.  Ease into it if you want to score that goal.
Don't tell her she's a racist, lead her to come to that conclusion herself.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A question often asked, particularly of racism training is, Are White people
really changing, or are they merely becoming more knowledgable racists?
I am convinced that awareness is not enough.  It is behavior that counts.
My charge to the user of this program is to impress upon participants on
the importance of changing not merely attitudes, but also behavior.
Stokely Carmichael's adage, &quot;If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So allow me to redefine racism from an internal thought process to only refering to external systems of power.
So I can justify my beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By processing participant's racism in Stage 1, the facilitator may shut them off.
Racist remarks and language, such as discussion of &quot;reverse racism,&quot; racist jokes,
and/or expressions such as &quot;blacklisting,&quot; and &quot;black sheep&quot; <em>[AN: whose origins have nothing to do with skin color]</em>
should be noted and processed at a point when participants can hear the comments and understand them.
What is important in this stage is that the facilitator beigns to develop a climate of trust and support.
The degree of rapport that the facilitator has with the group, as well as the feeling on the group itself,
will either help or seriously hinder the learning of the participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know they have, like, the best of intentions and everything, but I wouldn't be surprised
if this is the same thing it says in the Scientology Indoctrination Handbook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rationale</p>
<p>So that participants will truly comprehend racism as a predominantly White problem,
they must be confronted with and become aware of the depth and breadth of racism in American society.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&quot;blaming the victim&quot; that is, negating the White problem; the responsibility of the White people
for institutional racism; and the reality that &quot;reverse racism&quot; does not exist in America today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least they said &quot;today&quot; and it was in the 70s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An important dynamic to try to achieve in the group during this stage is ownership of racism as a White problem,
including some acceptance of responsibility to make changes in the system to combat it.</p>
<p>It is also crucial to focust on White people's behavior.  The group may ofthen attempt to change
the focus of the discussion to identify instances and systems of Third World &quot;racism&quot; (&quot;reverse racism&quot;).
It is important to process this reaction and discuss the groups's need for flight from some of the real issues
of racism in American society and from a close look at the American system as a whole, in which White racism is pervasive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you can clearly se that P+P=R is completely motivated reasoning in order to push this ideology.
This definition change is based around activism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last stage one clear objective must be met if the training program is successful.
Participants must leave it willing and ready to take action against racism.  This phase is called &quot;becoming an anti-racist racist.&quot;
An anti-racist racist is a white person who understands his or her racism, understands that,
given the dynamics of racism in the United States today, he or she will always be racist,
but takes action to try to combat it in situations where he or she has some power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well isn't that just wonderful?  A really good way to motivate people to motivate racism.
You can't be not-racist, all you can really hope to be is a racist who's against racism.
Jee, I wonder why this kind of thinking didn't become mainstream back then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, an anti-racist racist is one who takes action to try to solve the White problem.
The most important point of this training program is that <em>inaction is racism.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We Whites must not only understand our racism how it developed and how it operates in our society
and in our personal lives but <em>do</em> something with that knowledge that will effect some change in our racist system.
That is the essence of the last stage and the purpose of the entire training program.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There's one more thing about Katz that I want to share with you:
she wrote an article on &quot;<a href="https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED319280/page/n11" title="Valuing Diversity on Campus: A Multicultural Approach. College Unions At Work Monograph Series Number 11">Valuing diversity on campus, A multicultural approach</a>&quot;.
Much like White Awareness handbook, it's all about how to get white people to fight against racism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possibly, 1996 won't look so different from 1896, when the Plessey v. Ferguson decision was made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you actually think that, you're a fucking crazy person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although this prediction seems bleak, there is some cause for hope that it will not come to pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, if you buy my &quot;Anti-racism training in diversity program&quot;!
I guess she wasn't crazy, just a good salesman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White culture results from a synthesis of ideas, values, and beliefs inherited from European ethnic groups in the United States.
As <em>the</em> dominant one, White culture acts as the foundation of our organizations and social instutions by dictating its norms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, we see the strange desire to label American culture as white culture.  Which gets us into this realm,
where the alt-right is arguing that American culture is white culture, thus we should kick out all the non-white people.
And the radical left is <em>also arguing</em> that American culture is white culture, thus we should not
promote assimilation and create separate standards for people, based on their skin color.</p>
<p>Yeeeeahhh.  How about you both fuck off and we can go back to advocating for American culture to be <em>American</em>, and not predicated on skin color!</p>
<p>And if you thought me comparing this to alt-right was unfair wait till you see this next part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By understanding White culture, one can begin to see thow it has become the basis for institutional norms,
and yet people of color are expected to feel valued by and comfortable with these norms.
U.S. instutions need to consider how their systems would operate if White culture were not the only legitimate one.</p>
<p>Table 1 outlines the basic elements of White culture.</p>

<p>These are all the terrible horrible things that white people are trying to imprint on the poor people of color in this country.
Oh, the humanity!</p>
<p>And in case you though the emphasis on the scientific method was weird, she brings it up multiple times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White culture also emphasizes the scientific method, which focuses attention on quantitative research.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Trap 3: Perceptions don't count--or--data, data, and more data</strong></p>
<p>Managers can also impede the development of a multicultural system by repeating requesting data about the problem,
To avoid taking action for change, an official asks for more research to prove a problem exists.
This reliance on data obscures the pain that people actually experience as a result of discrimination.
As Peters and Waterman (1982)point out, perceptions are real and need to be taken as such.
Colleges and universities are particularly prone to falling into this trap because they
routinely rely on quantitative research to &quot;prove&quot; reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oooh, I get it!  Because you can't prove your case with fact, we should just, you know, do away with the importance of the scientific method.
<em><sarcasm>Good plan!</sarcasm></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, universities and other educational institutions are entirely based on White cultural norms and value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean, American norms and values.  In the country of America that's a good things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, individual racism thrives on passivity.  Individuals support racism by failing
to confront and challange the cultural, institutional, and individual acts of oppression they see.
Doing nothing or remaining silent supports discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Trap 5: Let's not upset anyone</strong></p>
<p>Cries of &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; often hamper institutional efforts.
Such outbursts are actually positive signs that the system and the rules are shifting.
When people of color and women are upset in an organization, few people seem concerned;
when White men begin to feel that changes are occuring, the movement often stops.
To avoid this trap, the significant people must recognize cries of reverse discrimination
as positive signs and be prepared to help threatened individuals understand how the system
is changing and how they can adapt to the new rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ooooh. So no wonder you want to go with the definition of racism that makes &quot;reverse racism&quot; impossible.
Because it's a sign of progress.</p>
<h2><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So as you can very clearly see, this definition change was intentionally created and pushed in order to get white people to think about racism and themselves differently.
It was an attempt to dismantle arguments they thought stood in the way of progress.
And try and force all white people to take action in dismantling this &quot;racist&quot; system.</p>
<p>So the next time someone tells you that P+P=R is the &quot;academic definition&quot; you can say: It was a definition created by activists in the 70's in order to win an ideological argument.
It was not based in facts or science, or any of that dreaded &quot;scientific method&quot;.</p>
<p>So where does the sociology angle come into all of this?  Because even if they didn't create it, there are now some sociologists advocating for P+P=R as well.
Are these sociologists also trying to push this redefinition in order to win an ideological argument
and are acting backwards to prove their wordlview by redefining the tools they're supposed to study the world?<br />
The short answer is <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>The long answer is... see you in part two!</p>
