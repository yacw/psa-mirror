# You Are Racist! The Truth and Origin of Power + Prejudice = Racism. (P+P=R)

By *PSA Sitch* 2018-09-12

##  Intro

Words have power.  They shape the way we think about the world.
And they often have emotions embedded within them.  Emotions attached to the concepts they represent.
Because of this, words are carefully selected by those trying to persuade you, or perhaps even manipulate you.

We see this ofthen in politics.  The negative term "flip-flop" is repranded to the nicer-sounding "pivot".
The boring term "estate tax" is rebranded as the "death tax".
Though with these examples, in order to influence the desired emotion, different words are used.

But now we're entering the new phase -- a far more dangerous phase, where instead of group rebranding an idea,
<!-- triangular trade clip -->
they're attemptying to redefine the word itself.
The most notable example of this in fiction is in 1984, where the authoritarian ruling party created a new language in order to change the way people thought and could communicate their feelings.
It was called Newspeak.
One example, as Jeorge Orwell described the word "free" still existed in the Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as
"This dog is free from lice." or "This field is free from weeds."
It could not be used in its old sense of "politically free" or "intellectually free", since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts.

Now, their redefining or limiting of what the word "free" meant was in order to push an ideological agend.
And in this video I will show you how the same thing is occurring today with the word "racism".

And it's not my interpretation or opinion that this attempt is ideologically drive and not in good faith.
I will show you how the individuals who created and pushed for this redefinition were very explicit and open about their intentions and motivations.

## Part 1

You may have been in the situation where you've seen someone on the internet say something like: *All white people suck, please retweet*

And you say: **Objection!**, that's racist.

To which they reply: *Racism against white people is impossible because racism equals prejudice plus power*

> Well, the dictionary defines racism as hatred or intolerance of another race or races.

To which they say: *This is the academic definition, and therefore it makes it better*

But you see, the thing is, it's not actually the "academic" definition as people like to claim.
Not ignoring, of course that the broad term "academic" could mean literally anything.
But saying "academic" gives it a little more weight than saying "the sociological definition".

> If you want to understand racism, you need to talk sociology.
And sociology explains racism as combination of prejudice plus power.

Now, most of us will accept this, since sociology is a study of groups and wouldn't be too shocking if a field about groups defined racism in a purely group settings.

But you see, the funny thing is...  It's not the official sociological definition either!

And now I present to you, a montage of sociological textbooks not defining racism as "Power + Prejudice".

And before you accuse me of cherry-picking... well, at this point I might as well be cherry-**forest**-picking,
I found only one.  *One.*  **Oooone** source that was not a individual person's research paper or article.
Only one that said:

> The Cambrige Dictionary of Sociology by *Bryan S. Turner*
>
> Finally, racism refers to the overall relations of domination and subdomination between groups
that flow from the hierarchical structuring of a given society based on racial distinctions.

Which sort of sounds similar to P+P=R.  But even they say:

> In sociology, where the distinction between race and ethnicity is uncertain,
it is best to limit "racism" to structures in which race is explicitly used to effect social domination.

Notice how it says "in sociology". They're very clearly limiting this to their specific area of study.

I mean, they also define rationalization as

> The historical development of institutional orders such as the law, the market, capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state

Instead of, you know, the lie you feed yourself when you try to justify something that you know is wrong.
And I don't hear anyone advocating for changing the general definition of "rationalisation".

Now you may have noticed that all the definitions I found were from introductory or general sociology textbooks.
And there's a reason for that: it's because there's a lot of disagreement in the field of sociology on how to study, define, or even understand the concept of racism.
And we'll be getting into that argument later.

So the question arises: if it's not an "academic" definition, and it's not the official sociology definition, what is it?

Well, sit on down, boy and girls and let uncle Sitch to tell you the tale of P+P=R.

Our story begins in the 1940s, where all internet stories begin, with the nazis!
People were sitting around, saying: Hey guys, we need to word to describe how
the white nazis went around trying to kill white jews and other white europeans.
What should we call this ideology of judging people based on what we consider "race".

Uuuuuuuuh.... Race... -ism?

And thus the term racism was born.
Yes, that's right, the term "racism" didn't come out of the 100+ years of horrendous enslavement,
torture and murder of africans and their ancestors by white people.
No!  It came out of the half decade of horrendous enslavement, torture and murder of white people by other white people.
So, you know, #WhitePeopleProblems.

Anyways, this is important for couple of reasons:

1. It shows how P+P=R is insufficient.

Because a lot of the jews in Germany, before the nazis took over, were economically well off.
They had power.  That's part of how the nazis got other germans to turn on the jews.
They labeled them as privileged oppressor keeping other germands down.

So the jews *had* power in Germany.  You know, untilt they didn't

2. This explains why the word "racist" in America is so powerful.

If the word was created to describe white people discriminating against and oppressing black people,
do you think that white bigots in the 40's and 50's who didn't want to give black people equal rights would *care* if you called them racist?
Of course not.  *That's the point of the thing,* to openly discriminate against black people.

No, people cared because calling someone a racist was like calling someone a **nazi**.
Yes, that's right folks, calling someone a racist was the original Godwin's law.
And since americans were, you know, pretty anti-nazi because of the whole *World War* and *mass genocide* thing,
the term "racist" had power behind it.

So where does the world's worst meme come from?

[Dabbing on them haters][worst-meme]

Okay, second worst meme.

[xkcd: Free Speech][second-worst-meme]

**Third** worst...

It's the 70's. It's right after that little thing you might have heard of called "The Civil Rights Movement".
Black people in America were finally granted equal protection under the law as white people.  Yaaay!

So that means racism completely disappeared and all people live together in perfect utopian haromny, right?

Bwa-ha-ha-ha ha... No.

Surprisingly, racists aren't like Tinkerbell.  When you stop beliving they exist, they don't suddenly disappear.
Because any wide-spread cultural shift takes time.
Especially one rooted in the systemic enslavement and discrimination and oppression of people for hundreds of years.
So some people were looking for way to speed up the process.  On the whole "getting rid of the racism thing".
This lead to many sociologists and psychologists arguing about the black community.

So enter the lady named Patricia Bidol, who at the time was a superintendent of a school district in Michigan.
And she looked at the situation and said: "the way to combat racism is through teaching", so she created a teaching manual
called "Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-media Social Studies *Curriculum* in Racism Awareness for the Secondary Level".
Quite the mouthfull.  And this, my friends, is where P+P=R originated.

Now you may think, it's a *little strange* that the supposed "academic" definition didn't originate in the academic or research paper.
Instead it came from a *curriculum*.  You see, when the topic of the black community sufferring from the effects of racism came up,
detractors of progressive policies would often say:

1. Black people have equal rights and protections now.  Any fault they suffer is their own.
2. I'm not racist.  I'm in favor of equal rights, but I'm just a blue-collar working white guy,
struggling to get by like everyone else.  I have nothing to do with any of that racist stuff.
3. Affirmative actions judge people by skin color, so they're all racist.

Bidol did not only believe that these arguments would get in the way of white people actively fighting against racism,
but fully expected that teachers being forced to sit through her education program would
bring up these points in an attempt to fight against anti-racist training.
So what did Bidol and similar-minded people of that time do?

They just said: "Fuck it!"  Flip the proverbial table over, and decided to redefine the word racism in a way so that the definition itself would counter these common arguments.

They redefined "racism" to mean

1. Because the American system is historically rooted in racism, today's system is still ingrained in racism.
2. All white people are inherently racist regardless of what they think as individuals, simply because they benefit from being white in America.
3. Affirmative action is not racist because I've arbitrarily decided that racism refers only to systemic action, and not to one's individual prejudice.
That way, only white people can be racist.

So P+P=R was created with the express purpose of winning an ideological argument.

Let me repeat that again:

### P+P=R was created with the express purpose of winning an ideological argument.

Now I want to make it clear: I'm not saying that the initial arguments are correct,
but they are arguments people were making, and you want to combat them, you must do so with facts and logic, and all of that good stuff.
Not just simply say *"Loool, I just simply redefine the word so I'm automatically right, and you're automatically wrong"*.
That's not how civil discrouse works.

Now, let me show you exactly what I'm talking about.
In 1973 Bidol and several others worked on the "Education & Racism: An Action Manual"
To get a good idea of where her mindset was, we only have to look at the preface:

> ## Preface
>
> "If you're not part of the solution, you must be part of the problem."
White educators in the United States to whom this report is addressed, are
part of the problem.  For too long we, as whites, have failed to explore what
it means to be white in a white racist society.  As long as we fail to examine
our motives in the area of face relations, especially the implications of white
privilege, the status quo of white racism will be maintained.

Now, again, this is important to remember that this was written in 1973, when things were definitely a lot more racist.
So I don't want to fall into the trap of judging the people writing this through the way in which society is today.
But by the same token, it's wrong for people to use the same ideology that was created in a very different time period
to [try to explain or justify things that are happening today][out-of-time].
Again, we could see that the express purpose is to motivate action.

> What is racism?  "Racism is racial prejudice (the belief that one's own race is superior to other race)
combined with the power to enforce this bias throughout the institutions and culture of a society."<sup>2</sup>
>
> <sup>2</sup> Bidol, Pat A. *Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-Media Socail Studied Curriculum in Race Relations for the Secondary Level.*
Revised edition.  Detroid: New Perspectives on Race, Inc., 1972. p. 1.

Now, you see them repeat the P+P=R and they cite Bidol, which is unsurprising, *considering she worked on this*.

> The major institutions of our society reinforce white racial prejudice because we have
whites control the decision-making and standard-setting process of these institutions.
Thus white-originated standards become normative, resulting in benefits for whites
just because they are white and in the oppression of blacks and other Third World people
because they are not white.

Now, later, we're going to get into how incredibly racist it is to believe that black people need different standards than white people.
But for now, let's just keep that in the back of our mind.

> One of our major institutions is the public school.  The schools (and we as educators)
are supposed to transmit our beliefs about ourselves as a nation (the pluralistic, democratic,
egalitarian ideology of our national self-concept) as well as the knowledge and skills necessary to survive,

Yes, this fringe group of people were trying to run this idea that all white people are inherently racist and P+P=R into our public school system in the 70's.

> *Until our motivations in the area of race relations, especially the implications of white privilege, can be consciously examined, the status quo will be maintained.
To eliminate racism from our society will require an examination and reorientation of our goals and priorities.
Effective reorientation will require education concerning the nature, practices, and effects of racism.
Whites will have to develop a new self-concept which will allow us to affirm ourselves without having to do so
by oppressing Third World people.*

Yes, for some reason back then, or at least in this report, they decided that calling people of color "Third World people" was Politically Correct thing to do.
I know, it doesn't make sense to me either.

> If we were to work on the elimination of racism from our society it is advisable that we work from a commonly agreed-upon set of definitions.
What follows is a set of meaning sthat provide on such common base and have proved accurate and helpful for several years.

We can clearly see that P+P=R's motivation is based around this idea of getting white people to reorient and develop
this new self-concept of what it means to be white, and how all white people in America are inherently racist.

> School systems reinforce white images and maintain the "rightness of whiteness" syndrome through curriculum materials.
In very subtle ways white aspirations, norms, and values are held out this textbook, for example,
at materials stressing the importance of eating three well balanced meals a day.
The meals illustrated are white middle class meals, served as viwed appropriate
by white standards and consisting of foods selected by whites as desirable.
Black and Third World youngsters cannot identify with that image and can only regard their
parents as failing them in some important way because they don't serve those same foods.

Because of course we all know what constitutes healthy food apparently changes on your skin color.

> No one is suggesting that we get rid of white Santa Clauses, white historical heroes, white myths, or white fairy tales,
for these are essential to the development of a healthy self-concept for white youth.
What we must do, if we are to eliminate cultural racism, is to supply additional symbols,
myths, heroes, and holidays with which black and Third World youngsters can identify.

This gos into this whole far-left notion that I *vehemently* disagree with.
The whole thing, ironically enough, sounds like "separate but equal".
What we *should be* pushing for in America is shockingly an American identity, not a racial or ethnic one.

This idea actually goes far further than today's critics that want more biological-based diversity in media, government and business.
This ideology promotes the motion that American values are actually white values,
And that all people have and should be taught a different value system.
This whole idea is the soft bigotry of low expectations.
Just look at the next part:

> ## Pitfalls To Avoid
> One is a tendency to "blame the victim" for his circumstances, even after carefully analyzing
these circumstances and agreeing what whites have systematically repressed an oppressed Third World peoples.
A good example of this tendency can be found in the famous Kerner Report, which documented at lenth
how certain elements in our schools, such as IQ test, teacher expectations, counseling practices,
curriculum materials, and tracking systems, are based upon white
racist ideology and are underlying causes of racial tensions.
What solution did the report suggest?
That we keep the inner-city schools become like the suburban schools!
We have instituted massive federally funded compensatory education programs
designed to bring white values and norms to those whom we have cause to be
"culturally deprived."  Such solutions are contradictory and racist.

That's right, folks!  Trying to make poor schools like rich schools is blaming the victim because we're infecting black children with our dreaded black values and norms.
So not only have these people redefined American values as white values, but they're saying that teaching black kinds to live up to the same values and norms as white kids is **racist.**

> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

> ## Becoming Antirasist/Racists
> As whites in a racist society we have only two behaviors to choose from
vis-a-vis the issue of racism.  We can choose to be racist/racists--those who
recognize the benefits accrued through being white and either consciously or
unconsciously support institutional and cultural practices that perpetuate racism.
Or we can choose to be antiracist/racists--those who recognize the illegitimate
priviliges obtained by whiteness but strive to remove these institutionally
and culturally racist benefits even while still receiving them.
There really is no place in between.

See?  Even if you're fighting your hardest to get rid of racism, you're still a racist.
Sorry guys, if there's no room for racists, whitey's gotta go.

Now I want to make it abundantly clear: I don't have a problem with people doing things or creating educational systems that are motivated by the desire to combat racism.
What I *do* have a problem with is trying to redefine a word in order to win an ideological argument.
There's a reason they chose the word "racism" to redefine instead of "Racial Prejudice".
They're trying to piggy-back off of the already estabilished power the word "racist" has,
and suddenly insert a different meaning to trick people into following their ideas.

Now even though Bidol created the term, she wasn't the one who popularized it.
There are a few people who are mostly creditet with spreading P+P=R.
One of them is Judith Katz.  Katz was also not a sociologist, but had a doctorate in education.
Currently she's the executive vice-president and client brand lead of the Khalil Jameson consulting group.
It's one of those organisations that large businesses pay to put on meetings for employees where they tell them how to not be horribly racist and sexist.

In 1978 she wrote the "White Awarenees Handbook for anti-racism training"
And if you hadn't guessed from the title, this is like Bidol's work,
and it's not an academic paper, but it's literally a handbook for anti-racism training.
But let's delve into it to see what we can learn.
